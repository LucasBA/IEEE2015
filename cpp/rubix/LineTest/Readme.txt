Super basic proof of concept for rubix identification algorithim.
Algorithm will:
-Get Picture
-Identify Edges (needs lots of work)
-Find Rubix Cube (not implemented yet)
-Generage Least Squares Line of rubix edges
-Use line to find angle

Ideally, this will identify a diagonal of the cube, and draw a line 
	segment along it. It will report the angle generated by this,
	after adjusting by 45 degrees.

Need to improve filter and plug into ROS.

For testing, you can use:
./LineTest <Filename>

Warning: It's not very good yet
