# IEEE 2015 Gazebo Simluation

## Installation

```sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-gazebo-ros-pkgs```
You should not need to install any other packages to make the simulator work. If you have any errors, see Nikita or Jacob.

## Usage

Do 
```roslaunch ieee2015_gazebo_sim gazebo.launch``` 
to start the simulation. You should see the robot (with some orange and blue coloring) flat on top of a black/white course.

## Notes

In the misc folder there's a lot of reusable urdf stuff, but none of it is actually used. 
It contains urdf stuff for a Kinect, and some other mish mash. Look through it if you are trying to add stuff.
