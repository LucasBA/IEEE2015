**Git Best Practices**

* Please include a readme.md with any new package. It should describe:
    * The topics it publishes to and listens to
    * A brief explanation of what the package does

* Commit ROS-ready code to the ROS directory under the appropriate package

* Commit non-ROS-ready code to the python, XMega or cpp directory as appropriate


Th-th-th-that's all folks!
